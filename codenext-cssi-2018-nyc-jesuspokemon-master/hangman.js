// This statement gives us all the 7 and 8 letter words from the list.
// Those seems like good lengths for hangman, but feel free to change it up.
let wordsToPickFrom = words.filter(word => word.length == 7 || word.length == 8);

// Let's make a hangman game. Step 1 is to randomly choose a word from wordsToPickFrom
// Use the random-int package and pick a random index from wordsToPickFrom
wordchosen =
// We will use an array to track the letters that the user has guessed so far.
// At the start, for a seven letter word that array will look like this:
// ["_", "_", "_", "_", "_", "_", "_"]
// Go ahead and create this array using a for loop. Note that its length will
// depend on the length of the secret word, so you cannot just say 7 in the for loop.
// We will call this array tracker. Whenever the user guesses letters that are in the word,
// We will replace the underscores (_) with the letter. So if the word is musical
// and you guess u, this tracker should become ["_", "U", "_", "_", "_", "_", "_"]

// Create a function called render that takes in the tracker array and prints it out nicely.
// When you print it out it should look like:
// _ U _ _ _ _ _
// (use join to make a string that looks like that)
// Call your functions with a few different tracker arrays to make sure it works

// The main part of the game is:
// Ask the user to guess a letter
// Use a for loop to go through the secret word string. Each time the letter the
// user guessed appears in that string, you should reveal the letter in the tracker array.
// After you fill in the letters in the tracker you should call the render
// function to print out the array.

// This should keep happening until all the letters have been revealed.
// To check that, you should write a function called isRevealed that takes in an
// array and returns whether or not all of the letters have been guessed.
// You can clear the console each time if you want to, but you don't need to.

// Once you have a basic version working, here are some wrinkles you can add if you want:
// 1. Keep track of the user's incorrect guesses and end the game if they guess wrong
// too many times, even if they haven't solved the puzzle.
// 2. List out the letters the user has guessed, so that they can see what
// they are and don't guess them again.
// 3. You could make it more of a 2-player game by allowing someone else to type
// in the secret word at the beginning rather than selecting it randomly.
// If you do that, make sure to clear the console, so the guesser cannot see what was typed.
