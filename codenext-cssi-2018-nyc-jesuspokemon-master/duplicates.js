// 1. Another way to use nested loops is to loop through the same array twice.
// One reason you might do this is to try to figure out if the array has any duplicates.
// The outer loop would track one item in the array, and the inner loop would
// go through all of the items in the array and check if they are the same as
// that first item. If so, the array contains at least one duplicate.
// But make sure you don't compare an item to itself, because that's not a duplicate.

// Get a basic version of this working. You should return true if there is at least one duplicated value.
function hasDuplicate(arr) {
  var counter = 0
  for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (i = "banana") {
      counter++

    }
    for (j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
      if (j = i) {
        c
      }
    }
  }
}
hasDuplicate(["apple", "banana", "pear", "banana"])
// Here are some examples you can use to test
// let arr1 = [3,4,5,6,7,1,2,5,9];
// let arr2 = ["apple", "banana", "pear", "banana"];
// Also make some examples where the answer is false



// 2. Once you have this version working, make a different version that
// tells you which items in the array are duplicated.
// For example, in [3,4,5,6,7,1,2,5,9] the only duplicate is 5
// However, in [3,4,5,4,7,4,2,5,9] the duplicates are 5 and 4 (which appears three times)
function listDuplicates(arr) {

}




// Bonus:
// 3. A related question (though one that has nothing to do with nested loops)
// is to find the mode (the item that appears most often) of an array.
// Write a function that does that.
function findMode(arr) {

}
// If you test with [3,4,5,4,7,4,2,5,9] it should return 4.
// If it's a case where multiple items appear the most, you can decide to either
// return just one of them, or to return all of them.
// For example [3,4,5,4,7,3,2,5,9] has three values that appear most: 3, 4, and 5.
